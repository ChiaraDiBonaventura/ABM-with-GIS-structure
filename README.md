An Agent Based Model with GIS structure to evaluate the effects of a Contact-Tracing App on Coronavirus spread

During the current pandemic of COVID-19 the importance of contact tracing 
applications has been an argument of debate. In Europe, the governments are
releasing these apps, each with its own characteristics, in Italy it is available Immuni.
We develop a SEIR agent-based model with GIS (Geographical Information System)
environmental structure to simulate COVID-19 dynamics as a function of the number
of people who use the app Immuni and the time lag that occurs between infection and
sending the warning message. In particular, we focus our work on the capital of the
most hit region by the epidemic, Milan. The study shows that the use of Immuni is
relevant only if a high number of Milanâ€™s citizens download the application.
Furthermore, to increase the efficiency of Immuni is essential to decrease the days of
delay between symptoms and the confirmation of being infected with a nasal swab.
